**Official Documentation:** https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/

## Model Overview

Gemini 2.5 is Google's **most intelligent AI model with thinking capabilities**, released in March 2025. It's a **natively multimodal model** built from the ground up to understand video, audio, images, and code just as easily as text, with state-of-the-art performance on math, science, and reasoning benchmarks.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Context Window:** 1 million tokens (exploring expansion to 2 million)
- **Multimodal:** Native support for text, images, video, audio, code
- **Thinking Mode:** Advanced reasoning with visible thought process
- **Best For:** Complex reasoning, multimodal analysis, math & science, research tasks
- **Benchmarks:** 18.8% on Humanity's Last Exam, state-of-the-art on GPQA and AIME 2025

## Core Strengths

### 1. Native Multimodality

Gemini 2.5 Pro showcases impressive **crossmodal reasoning** across texts, images, video, audio, and code - understanding and generating across all formats seamlessly.

### 2. Advanced Thinking Capabilities

Without test-time techniques that increase cost (like majority voting), 2.5 Pro leads in math and science benchmarks, demonstrating sophisticated reasoning.

### 3. Long Context Window

1M token context window with expansion to 2M tokens being explored, enabling comprehensive document and codebase analysis.

## Prompting Best Practices

### 1. Leverage Multimodal Capabilities

Combine multiple input types for richer context and better results.

**Multimodal Example:**
```python
import google.generativeai as genai
import PIL.Image

model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-2.5-pro')

image = PIL.Image.open('architecture_diagram.png')
code_file = open('implementation.py').read()

prompt = f"""
Analyze this system architecture diagram and the corresponding code implementation.

Questions:
1. Does the code match the architecture?
2. Are there any missing components?
3. What security considerations are not addressed?

Code:
```python
{code_file}
```
"""

response = model.generate_content([prompt, image])
print(response.text)
```

### 2. Enable Thinking Mode for Complex Reasoning

For advanced reasoning tasks, enable thinking mode to see the model's thought process.

**Thinking Mode Example:**
```python
response = model.generate_content(
    """
    Solve this multi-step optimization problem:

    A company has 3 warehouses and 5 retail stores. Shipping costs vary by
    distance. Current inventory levels and demand forecasts are provided.
    Design an optimal distribution strategy minimizing costs while meeting
    all demand within 48 hours.

    [data provided]
    """,
    generation_config={
        "thinking_mode": True,
        "temperature": 0.2,
        "max_output_tokens": 8192
    }
)
```

### 3. Use Natural Language with Context

Provide comprehensive context and use conversational prompts.

**Natural Language Example:**
```
You are an expert data scientist analyzing customer churn patterns.

Context: Our SaaS platform has seen 15% churn increase in Q1 2025.
We have 3 years of historical data including user behavior, support
tickets, feature usage, and payment history.

Data: [CSV data]

Task: Identify the top 3 factors driving churn and propose data-driven
interventions. Use statistical analysis and provide confidence intervals.
```

### 4. Temperature Settings by Task Type

**For Reasoning Tasks** (temperature: 0.2):
- Mathematical proofs
- Code generation
- Scientific analysis
- Logical problem-solving
- Data extraction

**For Creative Tasks** (temperature: 1.5-2.0):
- Image generation
- Video creation
- Music composition
- Creative writing
- Brainstorming

### 5. Structure for Long Context Tasks

When using the 1M token context, structure your prompt clearly.

**Long Context Pattern:**
```
OBJECTIVE:
[Clear statement of what you need]

CONTEXT:
[Background information - up to 500K tokens]

DOCUMENTS:
Document 1: [content]
Document 2: [content]
...
Document 50: [content]

ANALYSIS REQUIRED:
1. [Specific question 1]
2. [Specific question 2]
3. [Specific question 3]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
[Desired format - JSON, markdown report, etc.]
```

## Advanced Multimodal Techniques

### Video Analysis

```python
video_file = genai.upload_file(path='meeting_recording.mp4')

response = model.generate_content([
    """
    Analyze this meeting recording and create:
    1. Full transcript with timestamps
    2. Summary of key decisions made
    3. Action items with assigned owners
    4. Sentiment analysis of participant engagement
    5. Follow-up questions that should have been asked
    """,
    video_file
])
```

### Image + Code Understanding

```python
flowchart = PIL.Image.open('system_flowchart.png')

response = model.generate_content([
    """
    Convert this flowchart into production-ready Python code:
    - Use async/await for I/O operations
    - Add comprehensive error handling
    - Include logging at key decision points
    - Generate unit tests for each component
    """,
    flowchart
])
```

### Audio Transcription and Analysis

```python
audio_file = genai.upload_file(path='customer_call.mp3')

response = model.generate_content([
    """
    Transcribe this customer service call and analyze:
    1. Customer issue and resolution status
    2. Agent performance (empathy, clarity, problem-solving)
    3. Compliance with call script
    4. Opportunities for process improvement
    5. Customer satisfaction indicators
    """,
    audio_file
])
```

## Best Practices by Use Case

### For Scientific Research

```
SYSTEM: You are a research scientist with expertise in [field].

RESEARCH QUESTION: [Question]

LITERATURE: [Papers, data, previous findings]

METHODOLOGY: Analyze using [specific methods] and provide:
1. Hypothesis testing results with p-values
2. Confidence intervals for key findings
3. Limitations and potential confounds
4. Recommendations for future research

Use thinking mode to show your analytical process.
```

### For Codebase Analysis

```
Analyze this entire codebase (200K tokens) and:

1. Generate architecture documentation
2. Identify technical debt (with severity ratings)
3. Suggest refactoring priorities
4. Find security vulnerabilities
5. Recommend performance optimizations

Provide specific file:line references for all findings.

[codebase content]
```

### For Multimodal Content Creation

```python
# Input: Image + description
image = PIL.Image.open('product.jpg')

response = model.generate_content([
    """
    Create comprehensive marketing content for this product:
    1. Product description (100 words)
    2. Feature bullets (5 key features)
    3. Target customer persona
    4. Value proposition
    5. Social media captions (Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn)
    6. FAQ (10 questions)
    """,
    image
],
generation_config={"temperature": 1.2}  # Higher for creative tasks
)
```
