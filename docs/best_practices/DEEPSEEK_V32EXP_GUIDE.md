## What Makes V3.2-Exp Special

### Experimental Features

**Latest Innovations:**
- Advanced reasoning patterns beyond standard DeepSeek-R1
- Experimental context handling techniques
- Novel prompting strategies being tested
- Cutting-edge model architectures

**Trade-offs:**
- **Pros:** Access to latest capabilities, best performance on new benchmarks

## Prompting Best Practices

### 1. Leverage Experimental Reasoning

Try advanced reasoning patterns not yet available in stable models.

**Example:**
```
Use advanced multi-hypothesis reasoning:

Problem: Design optimal database sharding strategy

For each approach, explore:
1. Generate hypothesis about performance
2. Test hypothesis against constraints
3. Refine or reject based on analysis
4. Generate alternative hypotheses
5. Converge on optimal solution

Show complete reasoning tree, including rejected paths.
```

### 2. Explore Novel Prompting Techniques

Experiment with new prompting strategies.

**Example:**
```
Use recursive problem decomposition:

Problem: Build a recommendation engine

Level 1: Break into major components
Level 2: Break each component into sub-problems
Level 3: Break sub-problems into implementation tasks
Level 4: Define specific algorithms and data structures

For each level, show reasoning about dependencies and priorities.
```

### 3. Test Cutting-Edge Capabilities

**Example:**
```
Analyze this codebase using experimental static analysis patterns:

[Codebase]

Apply:
- Advanced type inference
- Cross-function data flow analysis
- Hypothetical execution paths
- Security vulnerability prediction

Provide confidence scores for each finding.
```

### 4. Provide Feedback

Since this is experimental, detailed feedback improves the model.

**Example:**
```
[After receiving response]

Feedback on reasoning quality:
- What worked well: [specific aspects]
- What could improve: [specific suggestions]
- Edge cases not handled: [examples]
- Alternative approaches to consider: [ideas]
```

## Recommended Parameters

**For Experimentation:**
```python

    "temperature": 0.7,     # Higher for exploring novel approaches
    "top_p": 0.95,          # Standard
    "max_tokens": 8192,     # Allow extended reasoning
    "experimental": True    # Enable experimental features (if available)
}
```

**For Stable Results:**
```python

### Use Stable Models For:
- ❌ **Production applications** requiring stability
- ❌ **Critical systems** where consistency is key
- ❌ **Large-scale deployments** needing predictable behavior
- ❌ **Cost-sensitive applications** (experimental may cost more)

## Stability Considerations

### Best Practices for Experimental Model

1. **Version Control Your Prompts:**
   - Document exact model version used
   - Track prompt changes
   - Note behavioral changes across versions

2. **Implement Fallbacks:**
   - Have fallback to stable model if experimental fails
   - Monitor for unexpected behavior
   - Validate outputs more rigorously

3. **Stay Updated:**
   - Follow DeepSeek announcements
   - Check documentation regularly
   - Join community discussions

4. **Contribute Feedback:**
   - Report issues to DeepSeek team
   - Share successful prompting strategies
   - Help improve future versions

## Migration Path

### From Experimental to Production

When experimental features stabilize:

```
1. Test prompts on both experimental and stable models
2. Compare outputs for consistency
3. Benchmark performance and cost
4. Gradually migrate traffic to stable model
5. Keep experimental for exploring next-gen features
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Cutting Edge:** Access to latest capabilities and research
2. **Experimentation:** Try novel approaches not in stable models
3. **Feedback Loop:** Your usage helps improve future versions
4. **Stability Trade-off:** More features, less predictability
5. **Research Value:** Ideal for exploring state-of-the-art techniques
6. **Migration Ready:** Plan transition to stable models when features mature
