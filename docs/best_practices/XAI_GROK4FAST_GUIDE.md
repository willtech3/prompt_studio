# Grok-4-Fast - High-Speed Reasoning Model Guide

**Last Updated:** January 2025

**Official Documentation:** https://x.ai/news/grok-code-fast-1

## Model Overview

Grok-4-Fast (including grok-code-fast-1) is optimized for **4x faster** performance and **1/10th cost** of competing models, making it ideal for rapid iteration, high-volume tasks, and cost-sensitive applications while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Speed:** 4x faster than competitors
- **Cost:** 1/10th of competing models
- **Best For:** Rapid iteration, high-volume production, cost-sensitive apps, coding tasks
- **Special Feature:** Native tool-calling support (grok-code-fast-1)

## Core Advantages

### 1. Rapid Iteration Workflow

**Philosophy:** Fire off quick attempts and refine based on results rather than crafting the "perfect" prompt.

**Workflow:**
```
1. Quick first attempt (30 seconds) → Get results
2. Review output (1 minute) → Identify gaps
3. Refine prompt (1 minute) → Add specifics
4. Re-run (30 seconds) → Improved output
5. Final refinement (1 minute) → Production ready

Total: ~5 minutes vs 20+ minutes of upfront planning
```

### 2. Cost-Effective Production Deployment

**Use Cases:**
- High-volume API endpoints
- Real-time code generation
- Batch processing (thousands of requests)
- Development/testing iterations
- Cost-sensitive applications

### 3. Native Tool Calling (grok-code-fast-1)

**Critical:** Use native tool-calling API, NOT XML-based tool calls (which hurt performance).

**Example:**
```python
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "execute_code",
            "description": "Execute Python code in sandbox",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "code": {"type": "string"},
                    "timeout": {"type": "number"}
                },
                "required": ["code"]
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "search_files",
            "description": "Search codebase for patterns",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "pattern": {"type": "string"},
                    "path": {"type": "string"}
                }
            }
        }
    }
]

# Grok-4-Fast will use these natively
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-code-fast-1",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Find all async functions and test them"}],
    tools=tools
)
```

## Prompting Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific with Code Context

Select exact code you want to reference.

**Example:**
```
Context Files:
@src/database/queries.ts - Current implementation
@src/utils/errors.ts - Error code definitions
@types/database.ts - Type definitions

Task: Refactor queries.ts to use error codes from errors.ts

Focus: Only modify query functions, preserve existing types
```

### 2. Structured Context with XML/Markdown

**XML Example:**
```xml
<context>
<file path="errors.ts">
export const ErrorCodes = {
  DB_CONNECTION_FAILED: 'DB001',
  QUERY_TIMEOUT: 'DB002'
};
</file>

<file path="queries.ts">
// Current implementation without error handling
export async function getUser(id: string) {
  return db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [id]);
}
</file>
</context>

<task>
Add comprehensive error handling using ErrorCodes from errors.ts
</task>
```

### 3. Leverage Speed for Iteration

**Example Iteration Flow:**

**Attempt 1 (30s):**
```
Generate a Python function to validate JSON schemas.
```

**Attempt 2 (30s after review):**
```
The previous function works but needs:
- Support for nested schemas
- Custom error messages
- Type hints
- Docstring
```

**Attempt 3 (30s after review):**
```
Add unit tests covering:
- Valid nested objects
- Invalid types
- Missing required fields
- Additional properties handling
```

### 4. Batch Processing

Use Grok-4-Fast for high-volume tasks.

**Example:**
```python
# Process 1000 code snippets
snippets = [...]  # 1000 items

results = []
for snippet in snippets:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="grok-4-fast",
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Analyze this code for bugs:\n{snippet}"
        }]
    )
    results.append(response.choices[0].message.content)

# Fast iteration = cost-effective batch processing
```

## When to Use Grok-4-Fast

### Use Grok-4-Fast For:
- ✅ **Rapid prototyping** and iteration
- ✅ **High-volume production** workloads
- ✅ **Cost-sensitive** applications
- ✅ **Code generation** and refactoring
- ✅ **Development workflows** with frequent iterations
- ✅ **Batch processing** tasks
- ✅ **Real-time code assistance**

### Use Grok-4 For:
- ❌ Complex strategic planning requiring deep analysis
- ❌ Multi-hour research synthesis
- ❌ Critical architecture decisions

### Use Grok-3 For:
- ❌ When cost is not a constraint and you need balanced performance

## Performance Optimization Tips

### 1. Minimize Prompt Engineering Time

Don't spend 20+ minutes crafting prompts. Iterate quickly.

### 2. Use Tool Calling Efficiently

**✅ Do:**
```python
# Use native tool calling
tools = [{"type": "function", "function": {...}}]
```

**❌ Don't:**
```xml
<!-- XML-based tool calls hurt performance -->
<tool_call>
  <name>execute</name>
</tool_call>
```

### 3. Batch Similar Requests

Group similar operations for efficiency.

### 4. Cache Common Patterns

Reuse successful prompts for similar tasks.

## Cost Savings Examples

**Scenario:** Code review for 500 pull requests/day

**Grok-4-Fast:**
- Speed: 4x faster (500 PRs in 2 hours)
- Cost: 1/10th of competitors
- Total: $X/day

**Competitor Model:**
- Speed: Baseline (500 PRs in 8 hours)
- Cost: 10x more
- Total: $10X/day

**Savings:** 90% cost reduction + 75% time savings
