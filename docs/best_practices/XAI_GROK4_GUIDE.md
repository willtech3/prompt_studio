# Grok-4 - Advanced Reasoning Model Guide

**Last Updated:** January 2025

**Official Documentation:** https://docs.x.ai/docs/models/grok-4-0709

## Model Overview

Grok-4 is xAI's flagship model with advanced reasoning capabilities, making it ideal for complex problem-solving, strategic planning, and multi-step tasks requiring deep analysis.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Best For:** Complex reasoning, strategic planning, advanced analysis
- **Strengths:** Multi-step reasoning, extended thinking, sophisticated problem-solving
- **Use Cases:** Research, complex coding, strategic decision-making, detailed analysis

## Prompting Best Practices

### 1. Leverage Extended Thinking

Request explicit reasoning steps for complex problems.

**Example:**
```
Analyze this system architecture and provide:

1. **Analysis**: Identify potential bottlenecks and failure points
2. **Evaluation**: Compare alternative approaches
3. **Recommendation**: Suggest optimal solution with justification
4. **Implementation**: Provide step-by-step plan

Use extended thinking to show your reasoning process.
```

### 2. Multi-Step Problem Solving

Break complex tasks into explicit steps.

**Example:**
```
Problem: Design a distributed caching strategy for our API

Please solve this step-by-step:
1. Analyze current bottlenecks
2. Identify caching candidates
3. Evaluate cache strategies (Redis, Memcached, CDN)
4. Design cache invalidation approach
5. Provide implementation roadmap

Format each step with reasoning and recommendations.
```

### 3. Strategic Analysis

Use for high-level decision-making.

**Example:**
```
Context: SaaS product with 100K users, considering architecture migration

Analyze migration from monolith to microservices:
- Current pain points
- Benefits vs risks
- Phased approach options
- Resource requirements
- Timeline estimates

Provide strategic recommendation with detailed justification.
```

### 4. Research and Exploration

Use DeepSearch for current information when needed.

**Example:**
```
Using DeepSearch, research latest best practices for:
- Kubernetes security (2025)
- Zero-trust architecture
- Container image scanning

Synthesize findings into actionable security checklist.
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Thorough System Prompts

**Example:**
```
System: You are a senior solutions architect with 15 years experience
in distributed systems, cloud architecture, and microservices.

Task: Design a scalable event-driven architecture for our e-commerce
platform handling 1M+ orders/day.

Expectations:
- Consider CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns
- Address eventual consistency
- Design for horizontal scalability
- Include disaster recovery strategy
- Account for regulatory compliance (PCI-DSS, GDPR)

Edge Cases to Address:
- Message ordering guarantees
- Duplicate event handling
- Partial system failures
- Network partitions
- Data migration during zero-downtime deployments

Output: Comprehensive architecture document with diagrams (described
in text), technology choices, and implementation phases.
```

### Comparative Analysis

**Example:**
```
Compare these three approaches for implementing real-time features:

1. WebSockets with Socket.io
2. Server-Sent Events (SSE)
3. Long polling

For each approach, analyze:
- Scalability (10K+ concurrent connections)
- Browser compatibility
- Infrastructure complexity
- Cost implications
- Fallback strategies

Provide recommendation matrix based on use case scenarios.
```
