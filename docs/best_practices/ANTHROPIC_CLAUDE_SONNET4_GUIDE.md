# Claude Sonnet 4 - Efficiency and Cost-Performance Guide

**Last Updated:** January 2025

**Official Documentation:** https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4

## Model Overview

Claude Sonnet 4 delivers exceptional **cost-performance balance**, achieving 72.7% on SWE-bench Verified while being significantly more affordable than Opus models. It's designed for high-volume production workloads where efficiency and quality must coexist.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Context Window:** 200,000 tokens
- **Output Tokens:** 32,000 tokens
- **SWE-bench Verified Score:** 72.7%
- **Best For:** Production workloads, cost-sensitive applications, high-volume tasks
- **Unique Strengths:** Efficiency, parallel tool execution, concise communication, cost-performance optimization

## Core Efficiency Features

### 1. Parallel Tool Execution

Sonnet 4 (and especially Sonnet 4.5) excels at **parallel tool execution**, maximizing actions per context window by running multiple operations simultaneously.

**Capabilities:**
- Multiple bash commands in parallel
- Simultaneous file operations
- Concurrent API calls
- Batch processing optimization

### 2. Concise Communication Style

Sonnet 4.5 has a **more direct, less verbose** communication style that skips unnecessary verbal summaries and jumps straight to action.

**Characteristics:**
- Skips verbose preambles
- Less explanatory text
- Focuses on results over process descriptions
- More efficient token usage

### 3. Context Management Efficiency

**Automatic History Cleanup:**
- Removes older tool results during long conversations
- Preserves recent tool interactions
- Prevents unnecessary token consumption
- Enables longer workflows without manual intervention

### 4. Filesystem State Discovery

Extremely effective at **discovering state from the local filesystem**, allowing you to start fresh context windows without extensive setup.

## Prompting Best Practices

### 1. Be Direct and Explicit

Skip politeness and verbose instructions. Focus on clarity and efficiency.

**Poor Prompt:**
```
Hello! I was wondering if you could possibly help me with something. I'd
really appreciate it if you could refactor this Python code to improve its
readability and efficiency, if that's not too much trouble. Thank you so
much!
```

**Better Prompt:**
```
Refactor this Python code to improve readability and efficiency. Ensure it
adheres to PEP 8 standards.

[code here]
```

### 2. Request Parallel Execution

Explicitly request parallel tool execution for independent operations.

**Parallel Execution Prompt:**
```xml
<task>
Set up a new FastAPI project with PostgreSQL.
</task>

<steps>
1. Create project directories (src/, tests/, migrations/)
2. Initialize pyproject.toml with dependencies
3. Create database models
4. Set up Alembic configuration
5. Create initial API routes
6. Write basic tests
</steps>

<instructions>
Make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool
calls where possible to increase speed and efficiency. Run multiple bash
commands simultaneously when they don't depend on each other.
</instructions>
```

### 3. Leverage Context Compaction

For long-running tasks, rely on automatic context management rather than stopping early.

**Long Task Prompt:**
```xml
SYSTEM: Your context window will be automatically compacted as it
approaches its limit, allowing you to continue working indefinitely from
where you left off. Do not stop tasks early due to token budget concerns.
Complete the entire implementation.

USER: Migrate this entire Django application from SQLite to PostgreSQL,
updating all 50+ model files, migration scripts, and configuration...
```

### 4. Structured, Minimal Prompts

Use structured prompts that are concise yet complete.

**Template:**
```xml
<task>
[What needs to be done - one clear sentence]
</task>

<requirements>
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]
</requirements>

<constraints>
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]
</constraints>
```

### 5. Specify Output Format Clearly

Be explicit about desired output format to avoid unnecessary formatting.

**Format Control:**
```
Respond in JSON format only:
{
  "status": "success" | "error",
  "data": {...},
  "message": "string"
}

Do not include any markdown, code blocks, or explanatory text.
```

## Optimization Techniques

### Maximize Parallel Operations

**Example: Project Setup**
```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key="your-api-key")

tools = [
    {
        "name": "bash",
        "description": "Execute bash commands",
        "input_schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "command": {"type": "string"}
            },
            "required": ["command"]
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "write_file",
        "description": "Write content to a file",
        "input_schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "path": {"type": "string"},
                "content": {"type": "string"}
            },
            "required": ["path", "content"]
        }
    }
]

prompt = """
Set up a React + TypeScript + Vite project:
1. Run: npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
2. Create src/components/Header.tsx
3. Create src/components/Footer.tsx
4. Create src/utils/helpers.ts
5. Install dependencies: react-router-dom, zustand, axios

Maximize parallel execution. Run all independent commands and file writes
simultaneously.
"""

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4",
    max_tokens=4096,
    tools=tools,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
)

# Sonnet 4 will execute multiple tool calls in parallel
```

### Batch Processing for Volume

**Example: Processing Multiple Items**
```
Process these 100 user records in the most efficient way possible:
[records here]

For each record:
1. Validate email format
2. Check for duplicates
3. Normalize phone numbers
4. Assign user tier based on signup date

Output only the JSON array of processed records. No explanations needed.
```

### Minimize Token Usage

**Reduce Markdown in Output:**
```
Provide the Python code for a REST API endpoint. Do not use markdown code
blocks, do not add explanations, do not add comments beyond docstrings.
Just the raw Python code.
```

### Efficient Context Discovery

**Starting Fresh:**
```
Analyze the current state of this project by examining the filesystem.
Identify:
- Project structure
- Key dependencies (from pyproject.toml or package.json)
- Existing features (from code)
- Current issues (from git status)

Then continue work on implementing the user authentication feature.
```

## Best Practices by Use Case

### High-Volume API Processing

```xml
<task>
Process incoming webhook events at scale.
</task>

<requirements>
- Validate 1000+ events/second
- Parse JSON payloads
- Route to appropriate handlers
- Log failures only (not successes)
</requirements>

<efficiency_requirements>
- Minimize token usage in responses
- Use parallel processing where possible
- Skip verbose logging
- Return only error summaries
</efficiency_requirements>
```

### Production Code Generation

```xml
<task>
Generate production-ready FastAPI endpoints for user CRUD operations.
</task>

<requirements>
- Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Input validation with Pydantic
- SQLAlchemy async models
- JWT authentication
- Error handling
- No comments (docstrings only)
</requirements>

<output>
Provide only the code. No explanations, no markdown headers, no
conversational text.
</output>
```

### Batch Data Transformation

```xml
<task>
Transform 500 CSV records into normalized database format.
</task>

<transformations>
1. Parse date strings to ISO 8601
2. Normalize phone numbers to E.164
3. Validate email addresses
4. Categorize by user_type
5. Generate unique IDs
</transformations>

<output>
Return only the JSON array of transformed records.
</output>
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Verbose prompts** | Be direct; skip pleasantries and unnecessary context |
| **Serial operations** | Explicitly request parallel execution for independent tasks |

# Process 100 user records efficiently
records = [...]  # 100 user records

prompt = f"""
Process these {len(records)} user records:

{records}

For each record:
1. Validate email (RFC 5322)
2. Normalize phone (E.164 format)
3. Assign tier: "free" if created < 30 days ago, else "trial"
4. Generate UUID

Return only a JSON array of processed records. No explanations.
"""

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4",
    max_tokens=16000,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
)

# Sonnet 4 returns concise, efficient output
processed_records = json.loads(response.content[0].text)
```
