# Claude 3.7 Sonnet - Hybrid Reasoning Model Guide


**Official Documentation:** https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet

## Model Overview

Claude 3.7 Sonnet is Anthropic's first **hybrid reasoning model**, capable of producing both near-instant responses and extended step-by-step thinking that is made visible to the user. This unique capability allows it to function as both an ordinary LLM and a reasoning model in one, where you can choose when you want the model to answer normally and when you want it to think longer before responding.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Context Window:** 200,000 tokens
- **Output Tokens:** Up to 128,000 tokens (thinking budget)
- **Unique Feature:** Hybrid reasoning with two operation modes
- **Best For:** Tasks requiring flexible reasoning depth - quick answers OR deep analysis
- **Availability:** Standard mode on Free tier; Extended Thinking on paid plans only

## Two Operation Modes

### Standard Mode
An upgraded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet that provides quick, efficient responses for straightforward tasks.

### Extended Thinking Mode
The model self-reflects before answering, which improves performance on:
- Mathematics and physics problems
- Complex instruction following
- Coding challenges
- Multi-step reasoning tasks
- Any task requiring deep analysis

**Performance Improvement:** Extended thinking reduces logic errors by up to 40% compared to standard mode.

## Prompting Best Practices

### 1. Set Clear Context

Instead of vague requests, provide comprehensive background details.

**Poor Prompt:**
```
Analyze this data.
```

**Better Prompt:**
```
Analyze Q1 2025 sales data from our e-commerce platform, focusing on
conversion rates and customer retention. Identify the top 3 factors
affecting performance and provide actionable recommendations.
```

### 2. Use Structured Components

Break down complex requests into clear sections using XML tags.

**Example:**
```xml
<task>
Review this Python codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
</task>

<focus_areas>
1. SQL injection risks
2. Authentication weaknesses
3. Data exposure in error handling
</focus_areas>

<output_format>
For each vulnerability found:
- Severity: High/Medium/Low
- Location: File and line number
- Description: What the issue is
- Recommendation: How to fix it
</output_format>
```

### 3. Control Thinking Budget

When using the API, you can control how much the model "thinks" before responding.

**API Example:**
```python
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet",
    max_tokens=4096,
    thinking={
        "type": "enabled",
        "budget_tokens": 10000  # Max thinking tokens (up to 128K)
    },
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Solve this complex optimization problem..."
    }]
)
```

**Thinking Budget Guidelines:**
- **Simple tasks:** 1,000-2,000 tokens
- **Moderate complexity:** 5,000-10,000 tokens
- **Complex reasoning:** 20,000-50,000 tokens
- **Maximum depth:** Up to 128,000 tokens

**Trade-off:** Higher thinking budgets provide better quality answers but increase latency and cost.

### 4. Request Explicit Thinking Blocks

For tasks where you want to see the reasoning process, explicitly request thinking blocks.

**Prompt Pattern:**
```xml
SYSTEM: For complex problems, use this structure:

<thinking>
Work through the problem step-by-step. Show all reasoning,
calculations, and considerations.
</thinking>

<answer>
Provide the final, polished answer based on your thinking.
</answer>

USER: A bakery sells cakes for $12 each. They offer a 15% discount on
orders of 10 or more, and a 25% discount on orders of 50 or more. If a
customer wants to buy exactly 100 cakes, what strategies could minimize
their total cost while getting all 100 cakes?
```

### 5. Iterate on Prompts

Claude 3.7 Sonnet benefits from iterative refinement.

**Process:**
1. Start with a basic prompt
2. Review the output
3. Identify what's missing or unclear
4. Refine the prompt with more specific instructions
5. Test again

**Example Iteration:**

**Version 1:**
```
Write a function to validate passwords.
```

**Version 2 (after seeing output):**
```
Write a Python function to validate passwords with these requirements:
- Minimum 12 characters
- At least one uppercase, one lowercase, one digit, one special character
- Cannot contain common words from a dictionary
- Return both a boolean and a detailed error message
```

## When to Use Standard vs Extended Thinking

### Use Standard Mode For:
- Simple Q&A
- Straightforward code generation
- Quick text transformations
- Content summarization
- Basic data extraction

### Use Extended Thinking Mode For:
- Mathematical proofs
- Complex debugging
- Multi-step logical reasoning
- Code architecture decisions
- Scientific analysis
- Agentic workflows requiring deliberation

## Code Examples

### Basic Usage (Standard Mode)
```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key="your-api-key")

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Explain Python list comprehensions in 3 sentences."
    }]
)

print(response.content)
```

### Extended Thinking Mode
```python
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet",
    max_tokens=4096,
    thinking={
        "type": "enabled",
        "budget_tokens": 15000
    },
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": """
        Design a database schema for a multi-tenant SaaS application
        with the following requirements:
        - User authentication and authorization
        - Data isolation between tenants
        - Audit logging
        - Support for 100,000+ users across 1,000+ tenants
        - Optimized for read-heavy workloads

        Explain your design choices and trade-offs.
        """
    }]
)

# Access thinking content
if response.thinking:
    print("=== THINKING ===")
    print(response.thinking)
    print("\n=== ANSWER ===")

print(response.content)
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Not leveraging extended thinking** | Use extended thinking for complex tasks that benefit from deliberation |
| **Vague context** | Provide specific background, constraints, and desired outcomes |
| **Ignoring thinking budget** | Adjust thinking budget based on task complexity |
| **Not iterating** | Refine prompts based on initial outputs for better results |
| **Overusing extended thinking** | Reserve it for complex tasks; use standard mode for simple queries |

## Performance Comparison

| Task Type | Standard Mode | Extended Thinking Mode |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Simple Q&A** | ✅ Excellent | ⚠️ Overkill (slower, more expensive) |
| **Code Generation** | ✅ Good | ✅ Better for complex code |
| **Math Problems** | ⚠️ Adequate | ✅ Excellent |
| **Debugging** | ⚠️ Adequate | ✅ Excellent |
| **Multi-step Reasoning** | ❌ Limited | ✅ Excellent |
| **Quick Iterations** | ✅ Fast | ❌ Slower |

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Choose the right mode** for your task complexity
2. **Set clear context** with specific details and constraints
3. **Use structured prompts** with XML tags for complex requests
4. **Control thinking budget** to balance quality, speed, and cost
5. **Iterate on prompts** to refine outputs
6. **Request explicit thinking blocks** when you need to see reasoning
7. **Leverage the hybrid nature** - start with standard mode, switch to extended thinking when needed
