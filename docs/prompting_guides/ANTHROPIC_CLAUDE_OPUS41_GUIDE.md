- Maintains consistency in refactoring changes
- Updates imports and references automatically
- Preserves existing functionality

### 3. In-Depth Research and Data Analysis

Improved in-depth research and data analysis skills, especially around detail tracking and agentic search.

## Prompting Best Practices

### 1. Provide Complete Context for Debugging

When debugging, provide full context including error messages, logs, and relevant code sections.

**Debugging Prompt Template:**
```xml
<bug_report>
Description: [What's wrong]
Expected behavior: [What should happen]
Actual behavior: [What actually happens]
Reproduction steps: [How to trigger the bug]
</bug_report>

<error_output>
[Paste full error message, stack trace, or logs]
</error_output>

<relevant_code>
<file path="src/auth.py">
[Code content]
</file>
<file path="src/database.py">
[Code content]
</file>
</relevant_code>

<environment>
- Python version: 3.13
- Framework: FastAPI 0.115.0
- Database: PostgreSQL 16
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
</environment>

<instructions>
Use extended thinking to:
1. Analyze the error and trace it to root cause
2. Identify all affected code locations
3. Propose minimal fix that doesn't introduce new issues
4. Explain why this fix resolves the problem
5. Suggest tests to prevent regression
</instructions>
```

### 2. Request Minimal, Surgical Changes

Explicitly ask for precise, minimal fixes.

**Minimal Fix Prompt:**
```
I need you to debug this issue with surgical precision:
- Make ONLY the changes necessary to fix the bug
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- Don't introduce new patterns or abstractions unless required
- Preserve existing code style and patterns
- Explain each change and why it's necessary
```

### 3. Leverage Extended Thinking for Complex Bugs

For non-obvious bugs, use extended thinking to see the reasoning process.

**Example:**
```xml
SYSTEM: For complex debugging tasks, use this structure:

<analysis>
Examine the code, error, and context. What are the potential root causes?
</analysis>

<root_cause>
Identify the actual root cause through step-by-step reasoning.
</root_cause>

<impact_assessment>
What other parts of the codebase might be affected? Are there similar bugs
elsewhere?
</impact_assessment>

<fix>
Provide the minimal fix with explanation.
</fix>

<tests>
Suggest tests to verify the fix and prevent regression.
</tests>

USER: [Bug description and code]
```

### 4. Multi-File Refactoring Prompts

When refactoring across multiple files, provide clear scope and constraints.

**Refactoring Prompt:**
```xml
<refactoring_goal>
Extract authentication logic into a reusable service class.
</refactoring_goal>

<affected_files>
- src/api/routes/auth.py (contains current auth logic)
- src/api/routes/users.py (uses auth)
- src/api/routes/admin.py (uses auth)
- tests/test_auth.py (existing tests)
</affected_files>

<requirements>
1. Create new AuthService class
2. Update all route files to use AuthService
3. Maintain backward compatibility
4. Don't break existing tests
5. Update imports consistently across all files
6. Add docstrings to new AuthService methods
</requirements>

<constraints>
- Don't change the API contract
- Preserve existing error handling behavior
- Keep the same authentication flow
</constraints>

<thinking>
[Plan the refactoring step-by-step before making changes]
</thinking>
```

### 5. Detail Tracking and Research

For in-depth analysis tasks, leverage Opus 4.1's improved detail tracking.

**Research Prompt:**
```xml
<codebase_analysis>
Analyze this codebase for technical debt and improvement opportunities.
</codebase_analysis>

<analysis_dimensions>
1. Code duplication (identify patterns that could be extracted)
2. Performance bottlenecks (based on code patterns)
3. Security vulnerabilities
4. Testing gaps
5. Documentation quality
6. Dependency health
</analysis_dimensions>

<output_format>
For each finding:
- Category (duplication/performance/security/testing/docs/dependencies)
- Severity (High/Medium/Low)
- Location (file:line or pattern description)
- Current state (what exists now)
- Recommended action (what should be done)
- Estimated effort (Small/Medium/Large)
</output_format>

<thinking>
[Methodically analyze the codebase, tracking details across files]
</thinking>
```

## Code Examples

### Debugging with Extended Thinking

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key="your-api-key")

bug_report = """
<bug_report>
Description: User login fails intermittently with "Session expired" error
Expected: Users should stay logged in for 24 hours
Actual: Some users get logged out after 1-2 hours
Frequency: ~20% of users
</bug_report>

<error_log>
[2025-01-15 14:23:01] ERROR: Session token validation failed
[2025-01-15 14:23:01] DEBUG: Token created_at: 2025-01-15 12:45:00
[2025-01-15 14:23:01] DEBUG: Current time: 2025-01-15 14:23:01
[2025-01-15 14:23:01] DEBUG: Time difference: 1.6 hours
[2025-01-15 14:23:01] ERROR: Token expired (limit: 24h)
</error_log>

<code>
# auth.py
def validate_token(token):
    created_at = parse_timestamp(token.created_at)
    now = datetime.now()
    expires_in_hours = 24

    if (now - created_at).seconds > expires_in_hours * 3600:
        raise SessionExpiredError("Token expired")

    return True
</code>

Use extended thinking to identify the bug and provide a minimal fix.
"""

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4.1",
    max_tokens=4096,
    thinking={
        "type": "enabled",
        "budget_tokens": 10000
    },
    messages=[{

    }]
)

if response.thinking:
    print("=== ANALYSIS ===")
    print(response.thinking)
    print("\n=== FIX ===")

print(response.content)
```

### Multi-File Refactoring

```python
refactoring_task = """
<files>
<file path="app/services/email.py">
def send_welcome_email(user):
    # Email sending logic
    pass

def send_password_reset_email(user, token):
    # Email sending logic
    pass

def send_notification_email(user, message):
    # Email sending logic
    pass
</file>

<file path="app/api/routes/auth.py">
from app.services.email import send_welcome_email, send_password_reset_email

@router.post("/register")
async def register(data: UserCreate):
    user = create_user(data)
    send_welcome_email(user)
    return user

@router.post("/reset-password")
async def reset_password(email: str):
    user = get_user_by_email(email)
    token = generate_reset_token(user)
    send_password_reset_email(user, token)
    return {"message": "Email sent"}
</file>

<file path="app/api/routes/notifications.py">
from app.services.email import send_notification_email

@router.post("/notify")
async def notify(user_id: int, message: str):
    user = get_user(user_id)
    send_notification_email(user, message)
    return {"message": "Notification sent"}
</file>
</files>

<refactoring_goal>
Create a unified EmailService class with proper dependency injection and
make all email functions async for better performance.
</refactoring_goal>

<requirements>
1. Create EmailService class with async methods
2. Add dependency injection for email configuration
3. Update all route files to use the new service
4. Maintain the same function signatures for backward compatibility
5. Make all email operations truly async
</requirements>

Provide the refactored code for all affected files.
"""

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4.1",
    max_tokens=8192,
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": refactoring_task
    }]
)

print(response.content)
```

## Best Practices by Task Type

### For Bug Fixes

**DO:**
- ✅ Provide complete error context (stack traces, logs, environment)
- ✅ Request minimal, surgical changes
- ✅ Use extended thinking for non-obvious bugs
- ✅ Ask for tests to prevent regression
- ✅ Request explanation of root cause

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Provide incomplete error information
- ❌ Ask for "improvements" when you just need a fix
- ❌ Skip test coverage for the fix

### For Refactoring

**DO:**
- ✅ Define clear scope and boundaries
- ✅ Specify constraints (backward compatibility, API contracts)
- ✅ Request consistency across all affected files
- ✅ Ask for step-by-step planning before changes

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Give open-ended "make it better" requests
- ❌ Skip defining success criteria
- ❌ Ignore existing patterns and conventions

### For Codebase Analysis

**DO:**
- ✅ Specify analysis dimensions
- ✅ Request structured output format
- ✅ Ask for severity ratings
- ✅ Request actionable recommendations

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Ask for generic "review the code" without specifics
- ❌ Skip prioritization (severity levels)
- ❌ Ignore estimation of effort

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Incomplete context** | Provide full error messages, stack traces, logs, and environment details |
| **Requesting too many changes** | Focus on one bug or refactoring goal at a time |
| **Missing constraints** | Specify backward compatibility, API contracts, and existing patterns to preserve |
| **No test requirements** | Always request tests for bug fixes and refactoring |
| **Vague error descriptions** | Include reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior |
| **Not using extended thinking** | Leverage extended thinking for complex bugs and design decisions |
